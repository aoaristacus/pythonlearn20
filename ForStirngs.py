# This code defines the use of indexing and slicing of characters inside a string

# Define a variable

stax = "This is a new world we are innovating"

# print the output of a variable

print(stax)

# Print Out numerous outcomes using spicing and Indexing and Reverse Indexing
# In Indexing, the first character is always defined as a "0" (This is very important when Indexing)

# example of extracting a character using indexing
print(stax[10])

# example of extracting a character using Reverse indexing
print(stax[-1])

# example of extracting a character using splicing

print(stax[-7:])

# example of extracting a characters using reverse indexing

print(stax[-7:-4])

# example of extracting a characters using indexing

print(stax[4:6])
